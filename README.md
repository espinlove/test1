stuff and things



## Tutorials_Quantics
In the following are a set of example calculations to introduce the basic ideas of quantum dynamics
calculations and how they are performed using the Quantics program.

The information given is reduced as the examples progress and looking back to earlier examples should give the answer as to how something should be done.

Included is the full workshop manual which gives all of the instructions and information for performing the Exercises.

On the Quantics website there is a section Cyber Training Workshop, Buffalo June 2023. All of the input files and the manual are also available in this section.

If you would like a copy of Quantics, instructions are also on the website.
